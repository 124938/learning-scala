## Declaring variables
* Immutable variable - val should be used to declare immutable variable 
* Mutable variable - var should be used to declare mutable variable


## Basic programming constructs
* Expression
* Nested block
* Condition block (if - else if - else)
* Ternary operator
* While loop
* For loop

_**Note:**_
- Scala is strongly typed programming language & type can be inferred automatically by scala compiler
- Python is weakly typed programming language

## Declaring variables
1. Immutable variable - val should be used to declare immutable variable 
2. Mutable variable - var should be used to declare mutable variable

Note:
-
- Scala is strongly typed programming language & type can be inferred automatically by scala compiler
- Python is weakly typed programming language

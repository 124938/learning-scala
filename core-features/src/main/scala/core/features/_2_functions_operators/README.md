## Functions
* Functional programming is a paradigm (like imperative and logical), which has following properties:
    * Functions are expressions (not statements)
    * Functions can be nested
    * Functions can be recursive
    * Functions can be assigned to variable
    * Functions can be passed to argument
    * Functions can be returned
* Advantages of functional programming
    * Simple reasoning principles
    * Better modularity
    * Good for leveraging multicore for parallelism and cloud computing
